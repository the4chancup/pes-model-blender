#
# .model files store mesh geometry as vertices, and faces that are sequences of
# vertices.
#
# Blender, and many other mesh editors, support a richer notion of geometry,
# consisting of vertices, faces, and loops. A vertex is a combination of a
# position and position transformation behavior (in .model context: vertex
# position, and bone mapping), and a loop is a vertex as it occurs in a
# particular face, adding rendering information such as normals, tangents,
# colors, and UV coordinates. Faces are a sequence of loops, not a sequence of
# vertices.
#
# If a vertex is rendered in different ways in different faces it occurs in,
# the vertex/face/loop geometry expresses this as a single vertex with multiple
# different loops; the vertex/face geometry would express multiple different
# vertices with identical position and transformation behavior instead. The
# advantage of vertex/face/loop geometry while editing a mesh is that the
# different loops making up a vertex can be edited as a unit, being able to be
# moved and transformed and such as a unit; whereas the vertex/face geometry
# would make it easy to accidentally move only one loop of a vertex, and create
# an inconsistent geometry thereby.
#
# The .model format natively stores vertex/face geometry only. This module
# implements a nonstandard .model encoding, compatible with native .model, that can
# preserve the vertex/loop relation. This information is encoded in the order
# of different vertices in a mesh.
#
# The encoding is defined as follows:
#
# Two vertices in a mesh of an .model file are considered *topologically
# equivalent* if they have the same vertex position, bone indices and bone
# weights. The values are compared as byte sequences as they are stored in the
# .model vertex buffer.
#
# The *nontopological encoding* of a vertex in an .model file is a summary of all
# vertex data stored in the .model file other than the three values that determine
# topological equivalence. It consists of the concatenation of the byte
# sequences encoding these vertex data points, in order of increasing data point
# type enum. For currently known .model versions, those are (in order) the vertex
# normal, color, UV coordinates in increasing order, tangent, and bitangent.
#
# If vertices X and Y are topologically equivalent, X is considered less than Y,
# denoted X < Y, if the nontopological encoding of X is strictly less than the
# nontopological order of Y, in lexicographical order. X < Y is not defined when
# X and Y are not topologically equivalent.
#
# The vertex/loop relation is encoded as follows: two vertices X and Y in a mesh
# of an .model file are loops of the same vertex if and only if:
# - X and Y are topologically equivalent; and
# - X < Y; and
# - vertex Y comes immediately after vertex X in the vertex buffer. That is, the
#   vertex index of Y is 1 + the vertex index of X.
#
# A mesh consisting of vertex/face/loop geometry can be stored using this
# encoding by first making a list of all vertices and loops in the geometry,
# and computing the .model bytewise encoding of each loop; collapsing identical
# loops for a vertex to a single loop; ordering the different loops of a vertex
# in order of increasing nontopological encoding; ordering different vertices
# that happen to be topologically equivalent in order of nonincreasing
# topological encoding, to avoid accidentally combining distinct vertices;
# and then adding these vertices to the .model vertex buffer in such a way that
# the loops making up a vertex make a contiguous block respecting this ordering.
#
# Meshes whose vertex buffers implement vertex/loop structure are marked by
# the `vertex-loop-preservation` mesh extension header.
